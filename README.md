##ABSTRACT
Safe interaction between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians requires accurate estimation of pedestrian intention through visual information analysis. In this study, we explore recent approaches and open challenges in pedestrian intention estimation using computer vision. We provide an overview of techniques, including those based on convolutional neural networks, LSTM, and probabilistic models. Additionally, we investigate challenges related to varying environmental conditions and the presence of partially or fully occluded pedestrians. Furthermore, we propose optimization techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of pedestrian intention estimation systems, with a focus on multi-modal data fusion and contextual information integration for a deeper understanding of human behavior in road situations.
Moreover, we examine the utilization of the Pedestrian Intention Estimation (PSI) dataset as a standard reference to evaluate the performance of pedestrian intention estimation algorithms. The PSI dataset comprises a wide range of urban scenes annotated with detailed information on pedestrian intentions, including directional movements, speeds, and predicted behaviors. Its diversity and richness make it a valuable resource for the development and evaluation of computer vision models for pedestrian behavior analysis. Finally, we discuss potential techniques for improving the efficiency of pedestrian intention estimation systems. Among these, the implementation of model compression techniques, such as weight quantization or parameter pruning, could enable more efficient model execution on embedded or real-time devices, making them more suitable for practical implementation in autonomous vehicle systems and driving assistance applications.
